    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>
      EasyNavigator aims to provide a faster way of browsing the
      web. It allows you to explore open tabs, lets you mark them
      for quicker access, and navigate between them. It also
      intelligently displays links to pages you tend to visit often so
      that repeating browsing activity is much more rapid.
    </p>

    <h2>Quick start</h2>
    <p>
      Install the extension and open one of your favorite web
      pages. Click on the new icon that appeared on the Chrome toolbar
      after installation. This shows a popup with a list of your
      recently and frequently visited pages within that website. Click
      'Mark' and observe the &#9733; that appears in the tab
      title. Switch to another tab and mark that as well. The popup
      should show the two tabs in the 'Marked tabs' list. Click on a
      tab in the list to switch to it or use Ctrl+Shift+Z to switch
      between all marked tabs. This is especially useful when you
      have many tabs open. Open a few more pages in new tabs, click on
      the icon once again and select 'Explore tabs'. This displays all
      open tabs compactly as a 'tree' which you can interact
      with. Click on one of the red circles to focus on that part of
      the tree.  Click on a tab icon to switch to it, or hover over it
      for a preview of the tab. &#9733; can be used to mark a tab. The
      tabs can be organized by website, category (eg. news;
      automatically set), or by the sequence in which you opened them.
    </p>

    <h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
    Some shortcuts may be unavailable if they conflict with other
    installed extensions. To fix this, open the web page
    chrome://extensions (copy and paste) and click on "Keyboard
    shortcuts" at the bottom.
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Ctrl+Shift+X</h4>
          Show main popup with quick-links.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Ctrl+Shift+S</h4>
          Mark or unmark current tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Ctrl+Shift+Z</h4>
          Switch to the next marked tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Ctrl+Shift+V</h4>
          Show visualization of tabs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Installation and permissions</h2>
    <p>
      EasyNavigator requires three permissions: 'Access your data on
      all websites' (to get the tab previews and to communicate with
      opendns.com), 'Read and modify your browsing history' (to show
      frequently/recently visited pages), and 'Access your tabs and
      browsing activity' (to access open tabs).
    </p>

    <p>
      After installation, depending on the number of icons already
      displayed, the address bar might need to be shrunk to see the
      EasyNavigator icon.
    </p>

    <p>
      EasyNavigator communicates with <a href="http://www.opendns.com">OpenDNS</a> to
      get the categories and only sends the host name of websites
      (eg. for google.com/search?q=... , only google.com will be
      sent). EasyNavigator does not send anything else from your
      browsing activity to anyone, so you may rest assured that your
      privacy is not violated.
    </p>
